# Network-steganography
Network steganography, the art of hiding information within network communications, offers a 
powerful alternative to traditional security measures. Unlike encryption which may draw attention due 
to its obvious security measures, steganography operates under the radar, making communications 
virtually undetectable to unauthorized observers. 
NetCloak implements three robust covert channels using HTTP, UDP, and DNS protocols - the 
backbone of modern internet communication. Each protocol offers unique advantages for covert 
communication, and our system leverages these characteristics to create a versatile toolkit suitable for 
various operational scenarios.
